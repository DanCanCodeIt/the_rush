### THE RUSH
1. ensure you have docker engine installed on your computer
2. start the application by running `make run`
3. once the application has built and started, populate it with data using `make migrate` 
- Note: if step 3 fails, retry again in a few seconds. Once the application is up, it takes a few moments for the database to become available
